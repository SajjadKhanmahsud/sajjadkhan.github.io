# As a Management Executive Officer in the Cartels and Trade Abuses Section at the Competition Commission of Pakistan, Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan, I am assisting in addressing anti-competitive practices outlined in Sections 3 (Abuse of Dominance) and 4 (Prohibited Agreements) of the Competition Act, 2010. Through my role, I assist in detecting cartels to foster economic growth and ensure fair competition within the market. Utilizing various tools and techniques, I support inquiry officers in creating an equitable playing field for businesses. Previously, I was a Young Development Fellow at the Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives. I am currently engaged in various research activities and projects related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). My work involves collaborating with various stakeholders to develop and implement policies and strategies that promote sustainable economic growth and development in Pakistan.
